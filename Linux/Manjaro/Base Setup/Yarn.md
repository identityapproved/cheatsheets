Yarn stands for _Yet Another Resource Negotiator_. 

Yarn executes these tasks in parallel, increasing performance.

__Zero installs__ store the cache in your project directory, in a .yarn folder. 

__Plug’n’Play__ is an alternative installation strategy. Instead of generating a node_modules directory and leaving the resolution to Node, Yarn generates a single .pnp.cjs file that maps packages to their location on the disk and to their list of dependencies.
