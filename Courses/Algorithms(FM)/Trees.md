### Terminology

_root_ - the most parent node. The First. Adam.  
_height_ - The longest path from the root to the most child node  
_binary tree_ - a tree in which has at most 2 children, at least 0 children  
_general tree_ - a tree with 0 or more children  
_binary search tree_ - a tree in which has a specific ordering to the nodes and at most 2 children  
_leaves_ - a node without children  
_balanced_ - A tree is _perfectly_ balanced when any node's left and right children have the same height.  
_branching factor_ - the amount of children a tree has.branching factor

#### Depth First Search

- use stack d.s.

#### Breadth-First Search

- use queue d.s.

#### Tree Comparsion

- DFS -> preverse shape
- BFS -> does not

#### Binary Search Tree

- find and insert
